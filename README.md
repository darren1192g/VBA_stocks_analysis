### The original VBA code ran “Year(2018)” in -79801.9 seconds. The refactored code ran “Year(2018) in 0.0625 seconds.

## Summary 

### The advantage to refactoring is the outcome for better code with the outcome being a faster run time. It gives you a chance to clean up your code and make it more readable. With that said going through the code to make proper changes did put up some roadblocks that had to be navigated around. In some areas I had to add new code and in other change names to match the new set of arrays. Adding more lines of code in I had to make sure I was starting and ending each section properly without error codes. In the end a cleaner and smother VBA code was the outcome that was needed to make this more efficient.
